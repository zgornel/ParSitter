# ParSitter

A tree-matching and code parsing library, written in Julia. Parsing based on the [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) library. Designed for easy parsing and querying of code ASTs.

## Installation

The installation can be done by manually by cloning this repository with:
```
git clone https://github.com/zgornel/ParSitter
```

Check out the [documentation](https://zgornel.github.io/ParSitter/dev) for information on using the library.

## Differences from TreeSitter.jl
This package differs from [TreeSitter.jl](https://github.com/MichaelHatherly/TreeSitter.jl) in that it calls the tree-sitter parsing CLI externally and reads directly the XML result. TreeSitter.jl provides a much tighter integration with the tree-sitter parsing and querying APIs. ParSitter provides a looser coupling with tree-sitter and more flexible querying mechanisms.
