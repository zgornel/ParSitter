# Introduction
ParSitter is a library for parsing and querying code. It supports parsing of code to abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and extracting information from the trees by executing code queries over the ASTs. This [paper](https://theory.stanford.edu/~tim/papers/ijcai11.pdf) provides a nice introduction into the main concepts behind the matching.

A code query is basically [tree pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching#Tree_patterns) with capturing of values. Throughout the documentation we shall refer to:
 - **target tree** the tree which one queries
 - **query tree** the tree which is used extract values from the target tree.

# Features
 - parsing of `Python`, `Julia`, `C`, `C#` and `R` through [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/)
 - tree matching using queries that can be expressed as `Tuple`s (in an [S-Expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) fashion)
